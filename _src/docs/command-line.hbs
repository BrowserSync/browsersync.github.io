For **tinkering** or quick examples and playing around, the command-line usage can be quite helpful.
After install BrowserSync globally, you can run it like this:

{{#hl lang="bash" }}
$ browser-sync start <options>
{{/hl}}

{{inc src="_includes/headerlink.html" title="Options" slug="command-line-options" }}

{{inc src="_includes/snippets/commands/options.html" }}

{{#loop page.items}}
{{inc src="_includes/headerlink.html" title=this.title slug=this.slug }}
{{hl src=this.file}}
{{/loop}}
